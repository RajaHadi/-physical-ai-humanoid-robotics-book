# Implementation Plan: Update Docusaurus Placeholders

**Branch**: `005-docusaurus-content-update` | **Date**: 2025-12-06 | **Spec**: [specs/005-docusaurus-content-update/spec.md](specs/005-docusaurus-content-update/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/005-docusaurus-content-update/spec.md`

## Summary

This plan outlines the approach for updating all default Docusaurus placeholders with actual book content for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" project. This involves replacing generic text, images, and links across the Docusaurus site's configuration, landing page, sidebar, and footer to accurately reflect the book's branding, titles, taglines, module summaries, and GitHub repository. The process will adhere strictly to Docusaurus standards and existing project structure, ensuring a functional and branded documentation site.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript (for Docusaurus config files, React components), Markdown (for content files). Assumes Docusaurus v3 framework.
**Primary Dependencies**: Existing Docusaurus installation, the full content of the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" book (titles, taglines, module summaries, chapter names for Modules 1-4), and appropriate AI/robotics branding images/logos.
**Storage**: Filesystem (modification of existing `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.md` files, and placement of static assets).
**Testing**: Verification will involve running `npm run build` to ensure the project compiles without errors and visually inspecting the generated static site in a web browser to confirm all placeholders are replaced and content is correctly displayed.
**Target Platform**: Web browser (Docusaurus static site).
**Project Type**: Web application (documentation site).
**Performance Goals**: N/A. This feature is a content update; performance goals relate to the overall Docusaurus site functionality (e.g., fast loading, responsive UI), which is already handled by Docusaurus itself.
**Constraints**: The updates are strictly limited to replacing placeholder content and assets. No UI redesign, custom component additions, new themes, new layouts, or changes to the Docusaurus core architecture are permitted. All modifications must use existing Docusaurus standards (Markdown/React) and maintain the current project structure.
**Scale/Scope**: Replace placeholders across key Docusaurus files: `docusaurus.config.ts`, `sidebars.ts`, `src/components/HomepageFeatures/index.tsx`, `src/pages/index.tsx`, and files within `static/img`. Removal of unused template Markdown files from `docs/`.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

*   **I. Technical Accuracy & Research Alignment**: **PASS**. This task focuses on content presentation rather than deep technical research, but ensures the site accurately represents the book's technical content.
*   **II. Clarity for Target Audience**: **PASS**. The primary goal is to improve clarity for the target audience (students/readers) by replacing generic placeholders with meaningful book information.
*   **III. Practical & Real-World Orientation**: **PASS**. This directly contributes to the practical presentation of the book, which has a real-world orientation.
*   **IV. Consistency via Spec-Driven Development**: **PASS**. The plan ensures consistent branding and information display across the Docusaurus site.
*   **V. Modular Structure for Docusaurus**: **PASS**. The updates will maintain and reinforce the modular structure of the Docusaurus content.

### Source Code (repository root)

The modifications for this feature will primarily occur within the `website/` directory, affecting Docusaurus configuration, components, pages, and static assets.

```text

    ├── tutorial-basics/ (REMOVE)
    ├── tutorial-extras/ (REMOVE)
    └── intro.md (REMOVE or update)
```

**Structure Decision**: This feature focuses on updating existing Docusaurus files and structure. No new directories or fundamental structural changes are introduced. The approach is to modify the content of specified files to reflect the book's information.

## Complexity Tracking

(No constitution violations to justify.)

---

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

**Status**: Not Applicable. This feature primarily involves content replacement based on existing information and clear requirements outlined in the spec. No research is needed to resolve "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" points.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

### Data Model (`data-model.md`)

**Status**: Not Applicable. This feature does not involve creating a new data model or database schema. It's a content update for an existing documentation site.

### API Contracts (`contracts/`)

**Status**: Not Applicable. This feature does not involve defining new API contracts or interfaces.

### Quickstart (`quickstart.md`)

**Status**: Not Applicable. This feature does not involve creating a new quickstart guide.

### Agent Context Update

(Automated update of agent-specific context with new technologies from this plan - if any significant new tech is introduced, which is unlikely for this task).
