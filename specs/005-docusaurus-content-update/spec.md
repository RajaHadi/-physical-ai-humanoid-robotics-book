# Feature Specification: Update Docusaurus Placeholders

**Feature Branch**: `005-docusaurus-content-update`  
**Created**: 2025-12-06  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Updating all default Docusaurus placeholders with actual book content, including titles, taglines, module summaries, sidebar, footer, metadata, and images for the 'Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics' project."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Brand Website with Book Content (Priority: P1)

As a reader/student, I want the Docusaurus website to accurately reflect the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" book, with correct titles, taglines, module summaries, and branding, so that I can easily understand the book's content and navigate the documentation.

**Why this priority**: This directly addresses the core objective of making the Docusaurus site a proper representation of the book, providing immediate value to all users by clarifying the site's purpose and content.

**Independent Test**: The Docusaurus website, when built and viewed locally, displays the correct book title, tagline, and module summaries on the landing page, and navigation links correctly reflect the book's chapters/modules.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** the Docusaurus site is loaded in a browser, **When** I view the landing page, **Then** I see the title "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" and the tagline "Embodied Intelligence, Humanoid Control, and AI Systems in the Physical World".
2.  **Given** I navigate the site, **When** I interact with the sidebar, **Then** I see correct chapter/module names (e.g., "ROS 2 Foundations", "Digital Twin", "NVIDIA Isaac Sim", "VLA Robotics LLM") instead of generic placeholders like "Docs", "Tutorial", "Intro".
3.  **Given** I view the footer, **When** I check its content, **Then** I see updated book/course information (e.g., copyright, project name) instead of default Docusaurus placeholders ("My Project", "Your Name", "Dinosaurs are cool").
4.  **Given** I view the site, **When** I check the site's branding elements (logos, images), **Then** I see images relevant to AI/robotics instead of default Docusaurus images/logos.

### Edge Cases

-   What if a placeholder text inadvertently remains visible on any page after the updates are applied?
-   What if an updated image or logo causes layout issues (e.g., incorrect sizing, misalignment) or breaks the Docusaurus build process?
-   How to handle internal links within markdown files that might point to old, placeholder-named pages or external links that point to incorrect GitHub repository URLs?
-   What if a Docusaurus configuration field (e.g., `baseUrl`, `editUrl` in `docusaurus.config.ts`) requires specific formatting that breaks the build if not adhered to?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

-   **FR-001**: The Docusaurus site MUST replace the default intro/landing page title with "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics".
-   **FR-002**: The Docusaurus site MUST replace the default tagline/subtitle with "Embodied Intelligence, Humanoid Control, and AI Systems in the Physical World".
-   **FR-003**: The Docusaurus site MUST replace default homepage sections (e.g., `src/components/HomepageFeatures/index.tsx`, `src/pages/index.tsx`) with concise module summaries for all completed modules (Module 1, 2, 3, 4).
-   **FR-004**: The Docusaurus site MUST update footer placeholders (e.g., copyright, project name, taglines) with correct book/course information.
-   **FR-005**: The Docusaurus site MUST update project metadata (e.g., `docusaurus.config.ts` `title`, `tagline`, `url`, `organizationName`, `projectName`, `editUrl`) with correct book and repository details.
-   **FR-006**: The Docusaurus site MUST update `sidebars.ts` and replace sidebar placeholders (e.g., "Docs", "Tutorial", "Intro") with real chapter/module names (e.g., "ROS 2 Foundations", "Digital Twin", "NVIDIA Isaac Sim", "VLA Robotics LLM").
-   **FR-007**: The Docusaurus site MUST replace default images/logos (e.g., `static/img/docusaurus.png`, `static/img/logo.svg`) with appropriate AI/robotics branding assets.
-   **FR-008**: The Docusaurus site MUST update all repository links (e.g., in `docusaurus.config.ts` or `README.md`) to point to the actual GitHub repository for the book.
-   **FR-009**: The Docusaurus site MUST remove all template/sample documentation markdown files (e.g., `docs/tutorial-basics`, `docs/tutorial-extras`, `docs/intro.md`) that are not part of the book's content.
-   **FR-010**: The update MUST only involve replacing placeholder content; no new UI redesign or component additions are allowed.
-   **FR-011**: The update MUST adhere to existing Docusaurus standards for Markdown/React components.
-   **FR-012**: The update MUST maintain the existing Docusaurus project structure.

### Key Entities

-   **Docusaurus Site**: The static website generated by Docusaurus, serving as the book's platform.
-   **Placeholder Text**: Generic strings within Docusaurus templates (e.g., "My Site", "Dinosaurs are cool", "Tutorial").
-   **Book Content**: Specific titles, taglines, module summaries, and chapter names for "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" and its modules.
-   **Branding Assets**: Images, logos, and icons relevant to AI and robotics.
-   **Metadata**: Configuration values within `docusaurus.config.ts` defining the project's identity and external links.
-   **Sidebar Configuration**: The `sidebars.ts` file, which defines the navigation structure of the documentation.
-   **Repository Links**: URLs directing to the GitHub repository hosting the book's content.

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes

-   **SC-001**: No default Docusaurus placeholder text remains visible on any page of the built site (`npm run build`).
-   **SC-002**: The intro/landing page title prominently displays "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics".
-   **SC-003**: The site's navigation bar and sidebar accurately reflect the book's chapters and modules, using their correct, user-friendly names and logical order.
-   **SC-004**: The project successfully builds (`npm run build`) without errors or warnings after all updates are applied.
-   **SC-005**: The site displays relevant AI/robotics branding images/logos instead of any default Docusaurus or generic images/logos.
-   **SC-006**: All repository links (e.g., in the navbar, footer, or any documentation) correctly point to the actual GitHub repository URL for the book.

## Assumptions

-   All necessary book content (titles, taglines, module summaries, chapter names for Modules 1-4) is explicitly available or derivable from existing `spec.md` and `plan.md` files for placeholder replacement.
-   Appropriate AI/robotics branding images/logos (e.g., a custom logo, social card image) are available and can be placed in the `static/img` directory.
-   The current Docusaurus version (v3) supports the planned content and structure changes without requiring major refactoring or complex custom plugin development.
-   Module summaries for the homepage will be concise text descriptions, either provided or derived from module `spec.md` summaries.

## Constraints

-   **Update only placeholders**: No UI redesign, new UI components, or fundamental changes to the existing user experience/interface are allowed.
-   **Technology**: Modifications must strictly adhere to existing Docusaurus standards, utilizing Markdown and React components within the current framework.
-   **Structure**: The existing Docusaurus project structure (file locations, folder hierarchy) must be maintained.
-   **Out of Scope**: Creating new themes or layouts, adding custom components beyond those already present, or changing the core Docusaurus architecture.
