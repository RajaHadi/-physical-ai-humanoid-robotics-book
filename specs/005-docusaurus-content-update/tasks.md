# Tasks: Update Docusaurus Placeholders

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/005-docusaurus-content-update/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Test tasks are not explicitly requested in the feature specification. However, validation tasks are included in the final phase to ensure documentation quality.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Project type**: Docusaurus static website content update.
- Paths assume the structure defined in `specs/005-docusaurus-content-update/plan.md`.

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Ensure necessary resources and environment are ready for updates.

- [x] T001 Ensure all necessary book content (titles, taglines, module summaries, chapter names for Modules 1-4) is explicitly available for placeholder replacement.
- [x] T002 Ensure appropriate AI/robotics branding images/logos (e.g., a custom logo, social card image) are available and placed in `website/static/img/`.

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core configuration and structural adjustments required before detailed content replacement.

- [x] T003 Update `website/docusaurus.config.ts` to replace placeholder `title` with "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" (FR-001, FR-005).
- [x] T004 Update `website/docusaurus.config.ts` to replace placeholder `tagline` with "Embodied Intelligence, Humanoid Control, and AI Systems in the Physical World" (FR-002, FR-005).
- [x] T005 Update `website/docusaurus.config.ts` to set correct `url`, `organizationName`, `projectName`, and `editUrl` to the actual GitHub repository (FR-005, FR-008).
- [x] T006 Modify `website/sidebars.ts` to explicitly define the sidebar structure with real chapter/module names (e.g., "ROS 2 Foundations", "Digital Twin", "NVIDIA Isaac Sim", "VLA Robotics LLM") instead of relying solely on `autogenerated` (FR-006).
- [x] T007 Remove template/sample documentation markdown files: `website/docs/tutorial-basics/`, `website/docs/tutorial-extras/`, `website/docs/intro.md` (FR-009).

**Checkpoint**: Core configuration and initial cleanup are complete, allowing specific content updates.

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Brand Website with Book Content (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: The Docusaurus website accurately reflects the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" book, with correct titles, taglines, module summaries, and branding.

**Independent Test**: The built Docusaurus site displays the correct book title, tagline, module summaries, and branded elements, and navigation links correctly reflect the book's content.

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [x] T008 [P] [US1] Update `website/src/pages/index.tsx` to display "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" as the main title (FR-001).
- [x] T009 [P] [US1] Update `website/src/pages/index.tsx` to display "Embodied Intelligence, Humanoid Control, and AI Systems in the Physical World" as the tagline (FR-002).
- [x] T010 [P] [US1] Update `website/src/components/HomepageFeatures/index.tsx` with concise module summaries for Modules 1-4 (FR-003).
- [x] T011 [P] [US1] Update `website/docusaurus.config.ts` to replace footer placeholders with correct book/course information (FR-004).
- [x] T012 [P] [US1] Replace default images/logos in `website/static/img/` with AI/robotics branding assets (`docusaurus.png`, `logo.svg`, `docusaurus-social-card.jpg`) (FR-007).
- [x] T013 [P] [US1] Ensure all repository links in `website/docusaurus.config.ts` and `website/README.md` point to the actual GitHub repository for the book (FR-008).

**Checkpoint**: All main content placeholders are replaced, and branding elements are updated.

---

## Phase 4: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Final verification and quality assurance across the updated Docusaurus site.

- [x] T014 [P] Verify no placeholder text (SC-001) or default Docusaurus content remains visible on any page of the built site (`npm run build`).
- [x] T015 [P] Visually inspect the intro/landing page for correct title and tagline display (SC-002).
- [x] T016 [P] Visually inspect site navigation and sidebar for accurate reflection of chapters/modules (SC-003).
- [x] T017 [P] Run `npm run build` in `website/` to confirm the project successfully compiles without errors or warnings (SC-004).
- [x] T018 [P] Visually inspect the site for correct AI/robotics branding images/logos (SC-005).
- [ ] T019 [P] Verify all repository links correctly point to the actual GitHub repository URL (SC-006).

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

-   **Setup (Phase 1)**: Must be completed first, ensuring necessary content and assets are available.
-   **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion. Critical for establishing the core configuration before content updates.
-   **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational phase completion. All content replacement tasks can run in parallel.
-   **Polish (Phase 4)**: Depends on User Story 1 completion for final verification.

### User Story Dependencies

-   User Story 1 has no external dependencies beyond the Foundational tasks.

### Within Each Task

-   Tasks should be performed sequentially within a file if they modify the same section, but tasks modifying different files can be parallelized.

### Parallel Opportunities

-   Tasks within the Foundational phase (T003-T007) can be parallelized if they modify different files.
-   All tasks within User Story 1 (T008-T013) can be performed in parallel as they primarily modify distinct sections or files.
-   All tasks within the Polish phase (T014-T019) can be executed in parallel for verification.

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Update Docusaurus config settings:
Task: "T003 Update `website/docusaurus.config.ts` title"
Task: "T004 Update `website/docusaurus.config.ts` tagline"
Task: "T005 Update `website/docusaurus.config.ts` metadata"
Task: "T011 Update `website/docusaurus.config.ts` footer placeholders"

# Update homepage content:
Task: "T008 Update `website/src/pages/index.tsx` title"
Task: "T009 Update `website/src/pages/index.tsx` tagline"
Task: "T010 Update `website/src/components/HomepageFeatures/index.tsx` with module summaries"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (Complete all tasks for a functional website)

1.  Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T002).
2.  Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T003-T007).
3.  Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T008-T013).
4.  Complete Phase 4: Polish (T014-T019).
5.  **STOP and VALIDATE**: Ensure the site builds and all placeholders are updated.

### Incremental Delivery

-   This feature is best delivered as a single, cohesive update to avoid intermediate states with partial placeholder replacements.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers, tasks within Phase 2, Phase 3, and Phase 4 that modify different files can be assigned to different team members for parallel execution.

---

## Notes

-   [P] tasks = different files, no direct dependencies, allowing for parallel work.
-   [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability.
-   Each task should be precise enough for direct execution.
-   Verify changes after each task or logical group.
-   Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence.
