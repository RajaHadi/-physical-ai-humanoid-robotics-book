# Tasks: Module 2 - The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-module-2-digital-twin/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Included as verification steps per user story (Content accuracy and manual validation).

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Documentation**: `website/docs/digital-twin/`
- **Static Assets**: `website/static/img/module2/`

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [x] T001 Create documentation directory structure in website/docs/digital-twin/
- [x] T002 Create static asset directory in website/static/img/module2/
- [x] T003 [P] Create 01-intro-digital-twins.md placeholder in website/docs/digital-twin/

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T004 Configure Docusaurus sidebar for Module 2 (autogenerated or manual update) in website/sidebars.js (if applicable) or verify autogen.
- [x] T005 Define glossary terms structure in 01-intro-digital-twins.md (or dedicated glossary file if preferred)

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Concept & Terminology Foundation (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Define Digital Twin concepts and standardize terminology.

**Independent Test**: Reader can correctly identify and define the 8 key terms listed in the glossary requirements.

### Chapter 1: Introduction to Digital Twins

- [x] T006 [P] [US1] Draft "Terminology Definitions" section in website/docs/digital-twin/01-intro-digital-twins.md
- [x] T007 [P] [US1] Write "Digital Twin Concept" explanation in website/docs/digital-twin/01-intro-digital-twins.md
- [x] T008 [US1] Create simulation pipeline diagram (Mermaid/ASCII) in website/docs/digital-twin/01-intro-digital-twins.md

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Physics & Sensor Simulation (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Explain physics simulation (Gazebo) and sensor modeling.

**Independent Test**: Reader can describe the configuration steps for a LiDAR sensor in SDF format.

### Chapter 2: Physics Simulation Basics

- [x] T009 [P] [US2] Create 02-physics-basics.md with Rigid Body Dynamics content in website/docs/digital-twin/
- [x] T010 [P] [US2] Add gravity/friction configuration examples (SDF) to 02-physics-basics.md

### Chapter 3: Sensors in Simulation

- [x] T011 [P] [US2] Create 03-sensor-simulation.md with sensor model content in website/docs/digital-twin/
- [x] T012 [US2] Add LiDAR configuration example (SDF) to 03-sensor-simulation.md
- [x] T013 [US2] Add Camera/IMU configuration examples to 03-sensor-simulation.md

### Chapter 4: Humanoid Modeling in Gazebo

- [x] T014 [US2] Create 04-humanoid-modeling.md with inertia/balancing content in website/docs/digital-twin/

### Chapter 5: Environment and Interaction

- [x] T015 [US2] Create 05-environment-interaction.md with terrain/obstacle content in website/docs/digital-twin/

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Unity Visualization & Interaction (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Explain Unity integration for high-fidelity visualization.

**Independent Test**: Reader can explain the workflow for importing a URDF model into Unity.

### Chapter 6: Unity Visualization

- [x] T016 [P] [US3] Create 06-unity-visualization.md with Unity Robotics Hub content in website/docs/digital-twin/
- [x] T017 [US3] Add URDF Import workflow description to 06-unity-visualization.md
- [x] T018 [US3] Add interaction scene setup guide to 06-unity-visualization.md

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Common Errors & Best Practices (Priority: P4)

**Goal**: Provide troubleshooting guide and simulation best practices.

**Independent Test**: Reader can list three common simulation errors and their corresponding fixes.

### Chapter 7: Simulation Best Practices

- [x] T019 [P] [US4] Create 07-best-practices.md with "Common Simulation Errors" section in website/docs/digital-twin/
- [x] T020 [US4] Add Sim-to-Real gap and latency content to 07-best-practices.md

### Chapter 8: Linking Modules

- [x] T021 [US4] Create 08-linking-modules.md connecting Module 1, 2, and 3 in website/docs/digital-twin/

---

## Phase 7: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [x] T022 [P] Verify all Mermaid diagrams render correctly in Docusaurus
- [x] T023 Check all links between chapters (01-08)
- [x] T024 Review Code Blocks for syntax correctness (XML/SDF/Python)
- [x] T025 Verify glossary terms consistency across all chapters

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### Parallel Opportunities

- Writing different chapters (Physics vs Unity) can be done in parallel.
- Creating diagrams can be done in parallel with writing text.

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Concepts)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Review definitions and pipeline diagram.

### Incremental Delivery

1. Foundation ready.
2. Add US1 (Concepts).
3. Add US2 (Physics/Sensors - Core technical content).
4. Add US3 (Unity - Visualization).
5. Add US4 (Best Practices).
