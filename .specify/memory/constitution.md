# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics – A Full Technical Book (Docusaurus Project) Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Technical Accuracy & Research Alignment
All content must be rigorously aligned with current research in Physical AI and humanoid robotics. Technical descriptions must be based on validated concepts from robotics, AI, and control systems. Speculative or unverified information must be clearly distinguished from established engineering facts.

### II. Clarity for Target Audience
Explanations must be suitable for intermediate-to-advanced learners in AI, robotics, and engineering. The writing should bridge the gap between academic research and practical engineering, avoiding unnecessary jargon while maintaining technical depth.

### III. Practical & Real-World Orientation
The book must emphasize practical application. Concepts should be illustrated with real-world humanoid robot systems, sensors, actuators, and AI-driven control mechanisms. Theory must connect to implementation.

### IV. Consistency via Spec-Driven Development
Consistency across all chapters is paramount and must be generated through Claude Code + Spec-Kit workflows. Terminology, formatting, and structural patterns must remain uniform throughout the book to ensure a cohesive reading experience.

### V. Modular Structure for Docusaurus
The content must be structured modularly to be optimized for Docusaurus documentation formatting. Each chapter and section should function as a coherent unit that renders correctly in a static site generator environment (Markdown-first).

## Key Standards

### Citation & Sources
- **Format:** IEEE style.
- **Source Types:** Robotics research papers, academic books, official documentation, reputable engineering sources.
- **Peer-Review Requirement:** Minimum **40% peer-reviewed citations**.
- **Prohibited:** Unverified blog posts or non-technical opinion pieces as primary sources.

### Reproducibility
All diagrams, code snippets, and explanations must be reproducible or testable where applicable. Code examples should be syntactically correct and conceptually sound.

### Writing Style
Clear, concise, structured technical writing. Active voice preferred.

## Constraints

### Volume & Structure
- **Length:** 20,000–30,000 words.
- **Structure:** Minimum 10 core chapters + appendix.
- **Chapter Components:** Each chapter MUST include:
  - Introduction
  - Key concepts
  - Technical explanations
  - Real-world examples or case studies
  - Summary
  - References

### Technical Format
- **Output:** Docusaurus-compatible Markdown.
- **Deployment:** Must be deployable to GitHub Pages.

## Governance

### Amendment Procedure
Amendments to this constitution require a formal review of the project goals. Principles can be added or refined as the book evolves, but the commitment to technical accuracy and Docusaurus compatibility is foundational.

### Compliance
All chapters must pass Spec-Kit Plus fact-checking. Zero plagiarism is tolerated. Docusaurus builds must pass with no errors.
